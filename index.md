Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's Data Science Institute, advised primarily by Rachel Cummings. I will be joining Northeastern University in Fall 2024 as a senior research fellow and in Spring 2026 as an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Science. 
 
I completed my PhD in Computer Science (with a secondary in Science & Technology Studies) at Harvard University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Salil Vadhan and Jonathan Zittrain. I was also a team member of OpenDP. My dissertation explores the technical, social, and political dimensions of differential privacy.
 
During grad school, I am lucky to have been a a Graduate Fellow at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Ethics, an intern at Microsoft Research's Social Media Collective mentored by danah boyd, and an Assembly Student Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.
 
My research interests include privacy and politics of data science. Please reach out if you want to chat about any of these topics!

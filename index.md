Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), advised primarily by [Rachel Cummings](https://rachelcummings.com/). I will be joining Northeastern University in Fall 2024 as a senior research fellow and in Spring 2026 as an assistant professor in the [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). 
 
I completed my PhD in Computer Science (with a secondary in Science & Technology Studies) at Harvard University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Jonathan Zittrain](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/jonathan-l-zittrain/) and work within the [OpenDP](https://opendp.org/) team. My dissertation explores the technical, social, and political dimensions of differential privacy.
 
Previously, I was a graduate fellow at the [Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Ethics](https://ethics.harvard.edu/), an intern at Microsoft Research's [Social Media Collective](https://socialmediacollective.org/) mentored by [danah boyd](http://www.danah.org/), and an [Assembly](https://www.bkmla.org/) Student Fellow at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/). I completed my undergrad at Yale University, where I competed on the varsity golf team. <i class="em em-woman-golfing" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="GOLF"></i>
 
My research interests include privacy and politics of data science. Please reach out if you want to chat about any of these topics!

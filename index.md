Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia's Data Science Institute, advised primarily by Rachel Cummings. I will be joining Northeastern University in Fall 2024 as a senior research fellow and in Spring 2026 as an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Science. 
 
I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Harvard, where I was fortunate to be advised by Salil Vadhan and Jonathan Zittrain. I also completed a secondary field in Science & Technology Studies. My dissertation explores the technical, social, and political dimensions of differential privacy.
 
During my PhD, I had the lovely experiences of being a team member of OpenDP, an intern at Microsoft Research's Social Media Collective mentored by danah boyd, a Graduate Fellow at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Ethics, and an Assembly Student Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.
 
My research interests include privacy and politics of data science. Please reach out if you want to chat about any of these topics!
